      <li><b>Cars sales and rent App</b>
        <p>This app sells automobiles and auto components, and it offers listings of
          numerous vehicles and descriptions of their attributes. Car accessories and parts
          are also included. This technology enables users to purchase inventory and cars
          online. The system enables users to check a variety of vehicle statistics, such as the
          engine, mileage, tank capacity, and other elements. There is a credit card payment
          option for auto parts. There are several ways to reserve a car, register, and even
          register for a test drive. The user of the system must register by providing personal
          information.
          After registering, a user can use the system by logging in with their
          username and password. The user can study each car's attributes and browse
          through various car listings. The user may also check features of the car along with
          inventory parts. The product can be chosen by the user and added to the shopping
          cart. By selecting the credit card payment option, a user can make a payment using
          a credit card. For the test drive case, the user has to register himself. In the section
          on buying cars, there are options for auto loans. This program combines inventory
          management for cars and automotive parts with sales management for cars. By
          employing this technology, a user can quickly buy an automobile or car parts
          without having to physically visit a store. He is able to see the car and its
          components using an efficient graphical user interface. To choose a better product,
          the user can check the features of each product and compare them.</p>

      <li><b>Cinema booking program</b>
      <p>A program that allows the user to book tickets to cinemas 
        and allows him to choose the time and seat 
        and the program consists of three classes each connected to the other.
        How it Works:
        When the program starts, the user is asked to enter the ID number 
        and enter his name and then the user moves to choose the movie where four 
        choices appear with their price and then the user chooses the time he wants 
        and the seat after that the ticket shows to the user with his information 
        and stored in the file and the user choose if he wants 
        to book another ticket or finish the program. </p>
